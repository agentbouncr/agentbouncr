# Contributing to AgentBouncr

AgentBouncr is maintained by a small team. We appreciate every contribution — from bug reports to documentation improvements.

## Best Ways to Contribute

- **Bug Reports** — Found something broken? Open an issue with steps to reproduce.
- **Documentation** — Typos, unclear explanations, missing examples — all welcome.
- **Integration Examples** — Built AgentBouncr into your stack? Share it in Discussions or as a PR to `examples/`.
- **Feature Ideas** — Open a Discussion first so we can align before you invest time coding.

## Before Opening a PR

1. Open an issue or discussion first for anything beyond small fixes
2. Fork → feature branch → `npm test` → PR
3. All PRs are reviewed personally — please be patient
4. New code needs tests. Run `npm test` and `npm run lint` before submitting.

## Code Style

- TypeScript in strict mode
- ESLint config included — run `npm run lint`
- Conventional commits preferred (feat:, fix:, docs:, chore:)
